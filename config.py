"""
Configuration and constants for Zen MCP Server

This module centralizes all configuration settings for the Zen MCP Server.
It defines model configurations, token limits, temperature defaults, and other
constants used throughout the application.

Configuration values can be overridden by environment variables where appropriate.

# Model configuration
# DEFAULT_MODEL: The default model used for all AI operations
# This should be a stable, high-performance model suitable for code analysis
# Can be overridden by setting DEFAULT_MODEL environment variable
# Special value "auto" means Claude should pick the best model for each task

# Note: When only OpenRouter is configured, these model aliases automatically map to equivalent models:
# - "flash" → "google/gemini-flash-1.5-8b"

# Temperature defaults for different tool types
# Temperature controls the randomness/creativity of model responses
# Lower values (0.0-0.3) produce more deterministic, focused responses
# Higher values (0.7-1.0) produce more creative, varied responses

# TEMPERATURE_ANALYTICAL: Used for tasks requiring precision and consistency
# Ideal for code review, debugging, and error analysis where accuracy is critical
TEMPERATURE_ANALYTICAL = 0.2  # For code review, debugging

# TEMPERATURE_BALANCED: Middle ground for general conversations
# Provides a good balance between consistency and helpful variety
TEMPERATURE_BALANCED = 0.5  # For general chat

# TEMPERATURE_CREATIVE: Higher temperature for exploratory tasks
# Used when brainstorming, exploring alternatives, or architectural discussions
TEMPERATURE_CREATIVE = 0.7  # For architecture, deep thinking

# Thinking Mode Defaults
# DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP: Default thinking depth for extended reasoning tool
# Higher modes use more computational budget but provide deeper analysis
DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP = os.getenv("DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP", "high")

# MCP Protocol Limits
# MCP_PROMPT_SIZE_LIMIT: Maximum character size for prompts sent directly through MCP
# The MCP protocol has a combined request+response limit of ~25K tokens.
# To ensure we have enough space for responses, we limit direct prompt input
# to 50K characters (roughly ~10-12K tokens). Larger prompts must be sent
# as files to bypass MCP's token constraints.
MCP_PROMPT_SIZE_LIMIT = 50_000  # 50K characters

# Threading configuration
# Simple Redis-based conversation threading for stateless MCP environment
# Set REDIS_URL environment variable to connect to your Redis instance
REDIS_URL = os.getenv("REDIS_URL", "redis://localhost:6379/0")
