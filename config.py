"""
Configuration and constants for Zen MCP Server

This module centralizes all configuration settings for the Zen MCP Server.
It defines model configurations, token limits, temperature defaults, and other
constants used throughout the application.

Configuration values can be overridden by environment variables where appropriate.

# Model configuration
# DEFAULT_MODEL: The default model used for all AI operations
# This should be a stable, high-performance model suitable for code analysis
# Can be overridden by setting DEFAULT_MODEL environment variable
# Special value "auto" means Claude should pick the best model for each task
DEFAULT_MODEL = os.getenv("DEFAULT_MODEL", "auto")

# Auto mode detection - when DEFAULT_MODEL is "auto", Claude picks the model
IS_AUTO_MODE = DEFAULT_MODEL.lower() == "auto"

# Model capabilities descriptions for auto mode
# These help Claude choose the best model for each task
#
# IMPORTANT: These are the built-in natively supported models:
# - When GEMINI_API_KEY is set: Enables "flash", "pro" (and their full names)
# - When OPENAI_API_KEY is set: Enables "o3", "o3mini", "o4-mini", "o4-mini-high"
# - When both are set: All models below are available
# - When neither is set but OpenRouter/Custom API is configured: These model
#   aliases will automatically map to equivalent models via the proxy provider
#
# In auto mode (DEFAULT_MODEL=auto), Claude will see these descriptions and
# intelligently select the best model for each task. The descriptions appear
# in the tool schema to guide Claude's selection based on task requirements.
MODEL_CAPABILITIES_DESC = {
    # Gemini models - Available when GEMINI_API_KEY is configured
    "flash": "Ultra-fast (1M context) - Quick analysis, simple queries, rapid iterations",
    "pro": "Deep reasoning + thinking mode (1M context) - Complex problems, architecture, deep analysis",
    # OpenAI models - Available when OPENAI_API_KEY is configured
    "o3": "Strong reasoning (200K context) - Logical problems, code generation, systematic analysis",
    "o3-mini": "Fast O3 variant (200K context) - Balanced performance/speed, moderate complexity",
    "o4-mini": "Latest reasoning model (200K context) - Optimized for shorter contexts, rapid reasoning",
    "o4-mini-high": "Enhanced O4 mini (200K context) - Higher reasoning effort for complex tasks",
    # Full model names also supported (for explicit specification)
    "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20": "Ultra-fast (1M context) - Quick analysis, simple queries, rapid iterations",

# OpenRouter/Custom API Fallback Behavior:
# When only OpenRouter or Custom API is configured (no native API keys), these
# model aliases automatically map to equivalent models through the proxy:
# - "flash" → "google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20" (via OpenRouter)
# - "pro" → "google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05" (via OpenRouter)
# - "o3" → "openai/o3" (via OpenRouter)
# - "o3mini" → "openai/o3-mini" (via OpenRouter)
# - "o4-mini" → "openai/o4-mini" (via OpenRouter)
# - "o4-mini-high" → "openai/o4-mini-high" (via OpenRouter)
#
# This ensures the same model names work regardless of which provider is configured.


# Temperature defaults for different tool types
# Temperature controls the randomness/creativity of model responses
# Lower values (0.0-0.3) produce more deterministic, focused responses
# Higher values (0.7-1.0) produce more creative, varied responses

# TEMPERATURE_ANALYTICAL: Used for tasks requiring precision and consistency
# Ideal for code review, debugging, and error analysis where accuracy is critical
TEMPERATURE_ANALYTICAL = 0.2  # For code review, debugging

# TEMPERATURE_BALANCED: Middle ground for general conversations
# Provides a good balance between consistency and helpful variety
TEMPERATURE_BALANCED = 0.5  # For general chat

# TEMPERATURE_CREATIVE: Higher temperature for exploratory tasks
# Used when brainstorming, exploring alternatives, or architectural discussions
TEMPERATURE_CREATIVE = 0.7  # For architecture, deep thinking

# Thinking Mode Defaults
# DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP: Default thinking depth for extended reasoning tool
# Higher modes use more computational budget but provide deeper analysis
DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP = os.getenv("DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP", "high")

# MCP Protocol Limits
# MCP_PROMPT_SIZE_LIMIT: Maximum character size for prompts sent directly through MCP
# The MCP protocol has a combined request+response limit of ~25K tokens.
# To ensure we have enough space for responses, we limit direct prompt input
# to 50K characters (roughly ~10-12K tokens). Larger prompts must be sent
# as files to bypass MCP's token constraints.
MCP_PROMPT_SIZE_LIMIT = 50_000  # 50K characters

# Language configuration
# LOCALE: Language setting for AI responses
# If set, adds language instruction to prompts (e.g., "zh-TW", "en-US")
# Leave empty for no language instruction
LOCALE = os.getenv("LOCALE", "")

# Threading configuration
# Simple Redis-based conversation threading for stateless MCP environment
# Set REDIS_URL environment variable to connect to your Redis instance
REDIS_URL = os.getenv("REDIS_URL", "redis://localhost:6379/0")
